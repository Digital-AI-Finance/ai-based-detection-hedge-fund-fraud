    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Dimmock et al. applied logistic regression to SEC filing data, demonstrating that past regulatory violations, ownership structures, and custody arrangements predict future fraud with an AUC in the range of 0.65-0.70.",

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Bao et al. applied a RUSBoost ensemble (combining random undersampling with AdaBoost) to detect accounting fraud, achieving an AUC of 0.725, substantially outperforming the logistic regression baseline.",

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "explanation": "Wang et al. applied a semi-supervised graph neural network to transaction networks, achieving an AUC of 0.87 and demonstrating that graph-based features substantially outperform tabular features alone.",

    "options": ["a) 1-2%", "b) 3-5%", "c) 7-10%", "d) 12-15%"],
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Multi-modal fusion of NLP features with quantitative return data has been shown to improve detection over either modality alone, with reported improvements of approximately 3-5% in AUC.",
