      "a) Deep neural networks",
      "b) Ensemble methods",
      "c) Logistic regression",
      "d) Graph neural networks"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "b",
    "explanation": "Random forests and gradient boosting provide the best balance, achieving high AUC (0.85--0.92) while maintaining interpretability through feature importance scores and SHAP values.",

      "d) Regulatory reform"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "a",
    "explanation": "The conclusion emphasizes that creating shared, privacy-preserving benchmark datasets is the single most critical enabler. Without accessible data, researchers cannot compare methods or validate improvements.",

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "explanation": "The conclusion stresses that production-grade fraud detection requires three-way collaboration: academics (methodology), regulators (data access, requirements), and industry (deployment, validation).",
